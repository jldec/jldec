# JÃ¼rgen Leschner

Software engineer and experienced EM/PM leader. Looking to join an awesome team.

I'm passionate about tools for editing and publishing online. Currently exploring AI and serverless at the edge.

I like to read and write and delete code, collaborate on issues and PRs, talk to customers, improve usability, build automation pipelines, measure performance, refine docs, support users, handle on-call, and more.
